Roboland is starting a production factory, we need robots to execute some tasks

# Use infinite loop for gameplay
# Create the board 10x10 (big matrix: list of lists)
# Create Robot class with x coord,y coord,name and code inside class constructor 
# Add a method definition for __repr__
# Place robot's code on the board in its x,y coordinate
# Print the board to screen
# Clean screen with: clear = os.system('clear')
# Give moving capabilities to robots
# Create an abstraction for the table width and height 
    (global variables instead of using 10 each time)
# Stop robots from falling off board
- Add a local git repository
- Add a remote github repository
- Add support for user input and execute user's commands with eval()
- Create a class RobotCollector that inherits from Robot and has the ability to
pick up things and put them inside its chest
